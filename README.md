# TOP-Todo-List

A project that was assigned, the project link could be found [here.](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list)
I got an idea to make a mock website of Microsoft Todo list app

## Problems
- I don't really know what to do at the start, so I look up many repos of previous learners to get an understanding of what structure I'll do.
- The Todo of Microsoft was easy on the first look, but struggle so much afterwards when doing little stuffs.
- I quite literally lost my mind towards the end of the project
- Nonetheless, it was quite fun doing this!
